# Sorting-Shakespeare

Shakespeares complete works can be sorted with the following methods:
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Bottom up merge sort
- Heap sort
- Trie sort

However, after running Selection sort for 5 hours and Insertion sort same O-notation, I have omitted these sorts from the code. Feel free to give them a try :)

Results for the other 3 sorts are as follows (words per millisecond):
- Bottom up merge sort: 430 WPMS
- Heap sort: 252 WPMS
- Trie sort: 2791 WPMS
